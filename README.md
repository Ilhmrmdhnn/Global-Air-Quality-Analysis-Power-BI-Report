## Description
This Power BI report provides a comprehensive overview of air quality metrics across various cities worldwide. It visualizes pollutant levels, trends, and correlations with weather parameters, enabling a better understanding of global air quality conditions.

## Key Features
- Interactive Map Visualization: Geographical distribution of PM2.5 levels.
- Trend Analysis Line Charts: Time-series analysis of various air pollutants.
- Comparative Bar Charts: Average pollutant levels across different cities.
- Correlation Scatter Plots: Relationships between different pollutants.
- Key Metrics Cards: Summary of important air quality metrics.
- Dynamic Slicers: Filters for Date, City, Country, and Pollutant.

## Objectives
1. Visualize Geographic Distribution: Show the distribution of PM2.5 levels globally to identify regions with high pollution.
2. Analyze Trends Over Time: Understand how pollutant levels change over time.
3. Compare Across Cities: Compare average pollutant levels in different cities.
4. Identify Correlations: Explore the relationships between various pollutants and weather parameters.
5. Provide Key Metrics: Highlight crucial air quality statistics for quick insights.
6. Enable Dynamic Filtering: Allow users to filter data interactively by date, city, country, and pollutant type.
